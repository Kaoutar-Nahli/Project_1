I chose a vibrant green color because it reminds me of the outdoors which I don't see often T_T because of this pandemic.||I love that this mat is made of TPE. TPE is a recyclable rubber and is more waterproof and so wouldn't absorb my excessive sweat. It was also important to me that I get a yoga mat that is thin but made of thick durable material. It's super lightweight and the strap is so useful for transport and neatness.||The 1/4 option was perfect for me because I use it in my carpeted room. If you're going to do a lot of exercises lying down, you might consider getting the 1/3 inch option that this brand offers.||||||4 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|Bennett Barouch|Good mat, good company|Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2021|Color: BlackSize: 6mmVerified Purchase|I found that having the side with the simple wavy lines up gives me better grip than the side with the more subtle pattern.

The pattern is vibrant, and rich in color. The mat is a good thickness, and really helps my joints from getting sore during workouts. The mat is also super soft.

In each I found a problem or two and had to get another one. Thin one was a problem so I got a thick one just to realize it makes hard to balance on the mat. Another problem is the surface. All of my mats don\u2019t have frictions strong enough on the surface so I keep sliding on certain pauses. Not to slide, I have to put extra strain on my wrist or fingers. Plus, as time goes by, the surface starts to wear out and the specks of the worn surface stick to my skin and clothes.||This one seems to have solved all those problems.||PS. Many reviewers mentioned it comes missing the strap. If you can\u2019t see the strap, the possibility is that you miss to locate it yourself. The strap is so thin and small that when you roll out the mat, it gets in the crease or the edge where you can\u2019t see. That happened to me, too. Look everywhere around the mat first. It\u2019s in a small (really small) plastic wrap.|Helpful|Report abuse|Amazon Customer|Good Value, quality feel|Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2018|Verified Purchase|Really like my mat.

The colors are beautiful. I like to visit studios while traveling and also take some online classes, so this is perfect for travel. I can see taking this to a studio while traveling and simply placing it on top of a regular courtesy mat. It's rather thin, and would be difficult to comfortably do poses on with just a hard floor underneath, but would be really nice for the hotel room and perhaps with a courtesy mat from a studio that I visit underneath, which is my intended use. It's truly credit card thick thickness. The side for hands and feet does have a soft, leathery feel ( I agree with another reviewer ). The bottom is actually quite similar to the sticky back of one of the thinner, actual yoga mats - the back has a rubbery feel and would probably grip a wood exercise room floor well. All of that said, the mat has a strong smell of rubber since I've just received it in the mail from Amazon today. The smell is so strong that I have to let it air out in another room to see if that helps. I'm very happy with this purchase given all of the benefits I found with this mat - lightweight, beautiful colors, easy-to-pack/fold for travel, fits easily in my carry-on, soft top, and sticky bottom.||Update February 5, 2020:|After letting this air out for one full day, I packed it up and took it on a trip. Left it unfolded in the hotel room and used it daily for stretches. Smell no longer that noticeable within a couple of days after initial unfolding at home when received. I had no problems refolding it and fitting it inside the plastic zippered travel pouch.|Read more|4 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|C. Juniper|Travel Bag Poorly Made; Not Sticky; Ultra Thin|Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2019|Color: BlueVerified Purchase|The travel bag was already broken open when I received the mat (pictured), so it's poorly constructed.||The mat is very, very thin, so not ideal for hard floors.||The mat has two different materials on each side: a leather-like (color) and rubber (black). The leather-like side is not grippy for yoga, I feel myself sliding for downward dog. If you flip it over to use the rubber side, it's grippy for yoga, but the mat stretches/slides on the floor.||For those who have issues folding the mat: you have to fold it exactly the way it came (like a map).||I don't recommend this mat even though it is compact enough for traveling.||||||||||5 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|Amazon Customer|Decent product but get a yoga towel instead|Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2020|Verified Purchase|Overall, this is actually an awesome product. It's super nice to the touch, didn't slip or slide during my kundalini practice, relatively easy to fold up. I actually wanted to give this a lower star review because it is much heavier and larger when folded up than I anticipated but asking for a foldable yoga mat is a big ask.||This mat is still portable and it will be nice to use on the beach but otherwise I don't see much value in it. The original price of $40 was just obnoxious and paying a lower amount is still asking for a lot. It's pretty and fancy but not so different from a yoga towel. If you want to splash out, this is a nice treat but if you're not doing yoga every day, save your money and bring a yoga towel to cover a studio yoga mat instead.||On a petty note, they sent me the gray carrying case but I wanted the cool clear case that is pictured with the product.

Overall it\u2019s a good mat and it\u2019s great for beginners or light stretching.||2 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse\", 'table': 'Color BlueBrand SKLMaterial Natural Rubber and SuedeProduct Care Instructions Machine Wash', 'text_other_colors': ['<span class=\"a-list-item\"><div class=\"tooltip\"><span class=\"a-declarative\" data-action=\"swatchthumb-action\" data-swatchthumb-action=\"{&quot;dimIndex&quot;:0,&quot;dimValueIndex&quot;:0}\"><span class=\"a-button a-button-selected a-button-thumbnail a-button-toggle\" id=\"a-autoid-10\"><span class=\"a-button-inner\"><button class=\"a-button-text\" type=\"button\" id=\"a-autoid-10-announce\" aria-label=\"\"><span class=\"xoverlay\"></span><div class=\"twisterSwatchWrapper_0 twisterSwatchWrapper twisterImages thinWidthOverride\" style=\"max-width: none;\"><div class=\" twisterImageDivWrapper\"><img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41FEM2Kb1eL._SS36_.jpg\" alt=\"Blue\" style=\"height:36px;

(It\\'s free for Prime Members and she\\'s a wonderful teacher ...Check her videos out!!!!). Yoga is something I\\'m getting so much benefit from that I wanted to set up a pretty little Yoga area that would not only remind me to get some \"mat time\" every day, but feel inviting. This yoga mat is so pretty and looks like an oriental rug, so it\\'s really nice to look at in your home. I set up my yoga area in our landing at the top of our stairs, and it\\'s such an inviting little yoga nook with this mat providing beautiful decoration. The BONUS I didn\\'t realize about this mat is that the patterns really help you line up your body for proper form. In plank it\\'s easy for me to have equal placement of my hands because the pattenrs give landing spots. The midline patterns help me line up for poses that cross the midline and in a hard holding pose in plank or on my stomach there are great focus points for my breathing. A blank mat doesn\\'t offer the visual help ....which doesn\\'t seem important until you start using one of these graphic mats and you realize how helpful the patterns really are! I often find myself listening to instruction on a pose and the patterns offer me places to set up the pose....like a Yoga Twister!||The only thing that I can\\'t give it a 5 stars for...is that is isn\\'t the stickiest mat I\\'ve ever used. It\\'s not slippery...so it\\'s not that big of an issue, but on certain poses and when I do HiiT Yoga I find my feet slip a bit. It\\'s minor but I couldn\\'t give it a full 5 stars as a result. I recommend this mat for style and visual help! And I also recommend any of Julia Marie\\'s programs...if you are Prime Member they are included in your membership... and if you aren\\'t a Prime Member she also has the same videos on YouTube.|Read more|4 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|Lucinda Ross|Really like my new mat|Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2020|Color: Baktiar BlackVerified Purchase|I have only used my new yoga mat 4 times this week, but so far, really like it. It is much softer and thicker than other mats I have used, which is a pleasant surprise. I know that others were complaining that it wasn\u2019t thick enough, but obviously, they haven\u2019t used a really thin mat before. I don\u2019t need something really thick, and this feels really nice to me. I am able to hold my poses fine, so it seems to be sticky enough. I find my mats get stickier with time and use, so this will probably be great in another month. It is super pretty. I don\u2019t know how well it will hold up, but if it holds up better than the last piece of junk I got from Gaiam (3 months and then it started sluffing off on my floor), I will be happy. It seems really well put together, and doesn\u2019t feel like pieces of it will fall off anytime soon. I haven\u2019t had it long enough to know. I love how it is heavy enough to lay flat on the floor and not move, even when I am jumping from pose to pose.

After a week, I noticed white spots (shown in the picture), then I realized it was actually pieces of the top layer of the mat that had just come off - little divits where they used to be. At first I thought it might have been like that when it came and I still really liked the pattern so I decided to live with it. Now this is happening all over the mat, with little red pieces all over my floor. I don\\'t know if this is a fluke or not, but it will likely eventually become a very expensive yardwork mat that used to be really pretty.||3 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|samdagiant|Beautiful and comfy!|Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2019|Color: Baktiar RedVerified Purchase|Beautiful yoga mat!

I got the pink color. I was always interested in starting but wasn\u2019t sure what yoga mat to go with or even if I would stick with yoga, so was cost conscious. My first impression was that I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and thickness of this mat. I am 5\u20196 and have no problem at all doing everything I need to on the mat with plenty of space. I don\u2019t slide on the mat, and it cleans so easily. It looks the same as the day I got it and I\u2019ve used the mat everyday. I have mine on carpet, so not sure how it would work on a different surface but can imagine carpet would be the hardest surface to work on. With the exception of combinations that require all body weight on one knee, the thickness of the mat is enough to cushion and support my body. Highly recommend for a first mat. It serves its purpose and a plus is its pretty! The last thing I\u2019ve really enjoyed is the strap it comes with. So easy to roll up and store as well as carry for class. Some other reviews have posted about a strange smell, mine did not smell. I have the pink and it hasn\u2019t worn down or left pink marks on the carpet or at the studio I take classes at. Give it a shot you won\u2019t be disappointed!||One person found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|Aurora Willows|Came damaged and dirty :(|Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2021|Color: BlueVerified Purchase|Your browser does not support HTML5 video.| Came damaged.

I would recommend this mat to my family and friends.||Helpful|Report abuse\", 'table': 'Color BlueBrand TobelifeMaterial Thermoplastic ElastomersItem Dimensions LxWxH 16.14 x 5.51 x 5.51 inches', 'text_other_colors': [], 'price_colors': []}""{'url': 'https://www.amazon.com/Luxury-Ashtanga-Professional-Carrying-Alignment/dp/B087BG2H4W/ref=sr_1_236?dchild=1&keywords=yoga+mats&qid=1624447198&s=sports-and-fitness&sr=1-236', 'name': 'Yoga Hero | Yoga Mat | 2-in-1 Mat+Towel | Eco Luxury | Ideal for Hot Yoga, Power, Bikram, Ashtanga, Sweat | Professional | Includes Carrying Strap', 'saleprice': 'Nan', 'ourprice': '$78.00', 'price_buybox': '$78.00', 'number_reviews': '21 ratings', 'rating': '4.9 out of 5', 'reviews_text_dict': 'Evan Hobbs|Yoga Hero 2 in 1 Mat/Towel Combo \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb|Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2021|Color: JungleVerified Purchase|This mat/towel combo is sturdy, yet comfortable.

Although it is thin, the natural rubber composition makes it stable on hard flooring and the microfiber top provides excellent grip for standing poses plus being absorbent. This is a very large mat at 5\\'6\" x 2\\'. IMO , the color/design selections are more attractive than the standard solid colors. The description states its machine washable but have not washed this yet so can\\'t attest to the results. It does roll up easily and comes with carry strap.||Thanks for reading this review and I hope the info was helpful.|One person found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|SnowedUnder|VINE VOICE|Beautiful and functional.|Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2021|Color: DesertVine Customer Review of Free Product( What\\'s this? )|I really like this yoga mat from Yoga Hero.||It isn\\'t too thick but still offers cushion and support. This yoga mat is very soft and feels very comfortable to use. It also has nice grip with an anti-slip coating. Given its thin nature, it is very light and easy to roll up and carry - the included carry strap is also a nice feature. I have a Manduka mat from their pro series and it weighs a ton so I use that one at home and take this one from Yoga Hero to the studio.||I also appreciate that it is free of silicone, toxic glue, and phalates - for peace of mind.||I chose the \"Desert\" pattern and it\\'s really cool! It is so beautiful and unique.||I\\'ve been using this yoga mat specifically for hot yoga and it has been great for this application. Its microfiber top layer absorbs sweat like a towel and is machine washable!

While I like that style, I find my feet slip and I\\'m not able to hold planks and pushups as easily because my feet keep sliding backwards off the mat.||This particular Yoga Hero mat is perfect and solves that problem!!!!|This Yoga Hero mat has a very nice, non-slip top on it. While it\\'s not squishy, it\\'s provides a lot of support for my feet and legs. The fabric top isn\\'t scratchy and seems to stay clean after a ton of uses.||The bottom side of the mat is more of a rubberized material. This allows the mat to roll out nicely and it stays 100% flat on the floor without edges rolling up or sliding around.||This mat is pretty heavy so it\\'s a bit difficult to carry on my back while I\\'m commuting on my bike. But it\\'s totally worth it because of how well this mat works!

I purchased this mat to use at the pole studio and its been working great for that purpose. It fits in my gym bag which is what I wanted! It keeps me off of the floor during warm ups. On days when I plan on a lot of floorwork/using my knees a lot, I use my kneepads while I warm up. It folds away and comes with a storage bag and a strap for those of you who prefer to roll your mat. When I train at home, I use my regular yoga mat. I do not recommend this to anyone with bad knees or who does long yoga sessions.

I just got them today. We\\'ll see how they do after washing, as there are no instructions! (Eek!)||Some things about me:|- casual yogi (beginner/intermediate) with knee problems. Otherwise I might be more hardcore.|- shoe size: women\\'s 7 (in Toms)|- sweat level: extreme. Walking casually around town in 80 degree weather will make my head, stomach, and underarms drool, possibly the bottoms of my feet, too. So I desperately needed something like this to help me stick to my mat better.||Pros:|-they definitely help you stick! You can feel and hear it just walking across the floor, but not in a glue-sticky way, just in a traction-sticky way.|- fit is great! See cons for minor issues (if even that--hence, 4.8 stars)|- pattern lines up on the bottom of my feet.|- stitching seems good. It\\'s thicker in the areas where there\\'s going to be more stress and strain to the fabric, protecting it from pulling apart.|- nearly seamless: aside from the holes, which have stitching around them to protect them, there aren\\'t any seams on these socks. No awkward bumps during yoga practice!||Cons:|- there\\'s a bit of pull between my big toe and index toe with these. Not enough to make them uncomfortable, but it\\'s noticeable. I rarely wear flip-flops, so it could just be that my toes are not used to this sensation.|- the ankle is also a little loose, but again, not even enough to take off a star. They stay up well, but it doesn\\'t hug like the rest of the sock.|- not as attractive as they appear in the picture. The ankle is a bit higher, making them slightly less attractive, but again: I don\\'t think it\\'s a big enough deal to remove a star, even combined with the above.|- scuffs the mat a little. I only noticed it the fourth time I used them. As I went from low lunge to downward dog, my feet dragged more than they have previously, and the scuffs are still there. They\u2019re not deep marks, but my mat is supposedly self-healing? Something to consider.||Then again, if I cared enough about how they looked, I\\'d have gone with the cuter ballerina-style ones I saw, also on Amazon.

So I ended up taking them off for the rest of my yoga class. I didn\\'t want to keep re-adjusting them over and over and over again. Saying that, I did like the color and non-slip dots on the bottom! The fit was good and the quality was good too. But since I practice yoga on a mat, with the dots on the bottom, it was taking that friction and rolling these socks off my foot. So mostly I use these on my hardwood floors when I feel like walking \"barefooted\", with the added warmth and protection. They are definitely good for hardwood floors.|25 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|Tim K.|Perfect socks for Pilates!|Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2017|Size: Small-MediumColor: TurquoiseVerified Purchase|My wife loves Pilates. She does it at least three times a week. The studio she goes to requires socks with grippers. I decided to buy her three pairs of Tucketts after looking at many options from different brands on Amazon. I\\'m so glad I went with Tucketts. She loves them. I bought her three different styles, because she is also a big fashionista and she likes to dress up for her workout, haha! She is obsessed with them. She loves how well they fit and the grippers are amazing (her words). She\\'s already asking for different colors.|31 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|Amazon Customer|Love them for summer!|Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2017|Size: Small-MediumColor: TurquoiseVerified Purchase|I am an avid sock or slipper wearer.

However, the mat is incredibly slippery. I've used it approximately 10 times now for 1.5 hour (room temp) yoga classes and I believe it's getting less slippery over time (maybe the coating is wearing down). I've tried spritzing water to see if that helps the grip. I've also tried it dry to see if that helps. It's always slippery. Especially if you're a beginner, you may find that the poses are harder because of the lack of traction, so I recommend finding a grippier option. I've begun bringing a towel with me to practice to put under my hands and/or feet to help keep them in place. Overall, it doesn't live up to the claim of being non-slip.|9 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|MHug13|This mat is slippery!|Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2020|Color: MoonlightVerified Purchase|I use this mat for about an hour 3x a week.

I\u2019m new to yoga and this is like the third different mat I\u2019ve tried from Amazon! The last one I received from another seller was really cute but so thin I could only use it on plush carpeted areas. This mat however is the perfect thickness so I can use it on any surface tile or carpet. It was packaged very nicely and I adore that it already comes with a holder! I got the pink and grey one and I love the shade of pink I was afraid it wouldn\u2019t be like the picture or be too thin but it did not disappoint!|28 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|Sylvia Wu|recommended and comfortable yoga mat|Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2021|Size: 72\"x24\"Color: Parfait Pink & GrayVerified Purchase|This mat is so light and beautiful!

It has no electronics, buttons, or moving parts, so I\\'m not sure how much there is to review.||The mat is a good size for my wife and teenage daughter. It\\'s too small for me 6ft 2, but that\\'s not a problem because large men are not the typical market for these products.||The material of the mat is billed as more eco-friendly. It feels fine to the hand and is sufficiently grippy to the hand and foot. Ours hasn\\'t gotten enough sweat on it for me to judge how funky it will get over time, and we haven\\'t had it long enough to judge durability.||The carrying bag is of decent quality and should give enough ventilation. The bundled cord also works fine, if for some reason the bag is abit bulky for your needs.|24 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|Jobobamobob|Nice mat for the price, saves my knees!

I\\'m a beginner so I wanted to get something affordable and simple first. This seems like it should hold up well, I imagine for many uses. I did notice my toenails sometimes leave indents in the mat, but if I\\'m careful it\\'s not a big deal and they don\\'t seem to actually rip it. The mat doesn\\'t have any abnormal odors that seem to happen sometimes in rubber products. I like the markers on it and the bag is especially convenient.|18 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|AmazonCustomerPcrooks|Yoga Mat|Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2021|Size: 72\"x24\"Color: Vibrant Green & BlackVerified Purchase|Perfect for yoga, and any other types of seated or floor exercises.

The cork top and rubber bottom made it amazing for standing work and anything that included being on my knees or elbows. It is great for balance - unlike my regular yoga matt this is a firm surface so I am not sinking while trying to balance. I found it worked really well for lunges, plank, etc. Basically anything where you want a no-slip surface that isn\\'t going to stretch. The one part I didn\\'t love it for were things like side-crunches, because while thick, it doesn\\'t offer much cushion. For me, the anti-slip aspect is more valuable than the extra padding, but depending on your practice, that may not be the case.

This mat is very nice for all types of workouts ranging from HIIT to yoga to cardio dance. One side is smooth and thats the side I use to work out on. It is soft and padded but not too padded where I feel I am falling into it. The other side has grooves and I feel that really helps it from not sliding around. I dont use a tool on this mat and even when I sweat I dont feel that the mat gets slippery.

I researched this chemical and others, looked at other yoga mats, and contacted customer service. The representative let me know that the chemical is only used in the filling and that the product is \"safe for my health.\" If that status changes, they\\'ll definitely hear about it from me. It was alarming initially to think a yoga mat designed to improve my health could simultaneously damage it! I hope their statement gives others like me some peace of mind.||It is made with TPE and built to last; if you\\'re looking for more environmentally friendly yoga mats and have a larger budget, the ones made of cork and different kinds of cloth seem excellent. The company Retrospec seems to be relatively eco-friendly, but I\\'d be interested in learning more about them (how much workers are paid, how safe working conditions are, etc). I hope to be able to use this yoga mat a long time. I\\'m happy with the color (periwinkle), thickness, length, and pattern design on each side. It looks like it will be easy to clean. Mine did not come with a strap.

It arrived half open and I\u2019m not kidding. The only reason I didn\u2019t take pictures of the wrapping is because I planned on keeping it since the quality based on reviews, seemed like it wouldn\u2019t been legit. Nope.

When the virus broke out I wanted my own mat to use for floor work at my local gym. I loved the mat for 5 months. It\\'s not very thick but that\\'s exactly what I wanted; thick enough to be a comfortable surface but not so thick it was hard to balance on. I stopped going to the gym in October when virus numbers went a little crazy; mat was rolled up in a closet for 3 months. I was so DISAPPOINTED today when I unrolled the mat to find a large (1.5\"x2\") air bubble had formed and half the mat had deformed. I can probably deflate the air bubble but the wavy mat edge looks permanent. As for the strap that came with it-fell apart in less than a week. Would not recommend this mat.||One person found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|Stephanie|Absolutely perfect!|Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2020|Color: TurquoiseVerified Purchase|Beautiful mat, and perfect color!

However, I think this actually compromises you where pressure and gravity are actually beneficial in certain poses. For example- in child's pose when having a little pressure on your forehead actually relaxes you. You're not going to get that with this mat. You'll need a block or something. Neither will you be able to splay your limbs out evenly in shavasana. Just stuff to keep in mind because it's so thick. The plus side is if your knees are sensitive- this mat is a dream. It rolls up pretty big. You can't use the strap for anything other than keeping it rolled and neat. I've also noticed it's not as sticky and slides when I try to hop on it. If I were to make this mat better, I'd fix that, 'cause that could be dangerous. Give it some texture on the underside and make the strap less flimsy. *shrug* I'll update my review after I've used it for a few months.|126 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|Amelia|LOVE IT!!|Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2018|Color: PinkVerified Purchase|Let me just say, this thing is AMAZING!! I love it!! One of my biggest downfalls to doing yoga was that I would have back pain and knee pain when doing poses that involved being on the floor. This is no longer a problem. I am so grateful to have this amazing mat! That being said, the only thing that I could say that's bad about it is that because of how squishy and wonderful it is, it makes it harder to do balancing poses like tree pose for example, but they can still be done as I'm still working on my balancing anyhow and I was able to do them. I have NOT had any problems with it rolling back up at one end on me either as I saw someone else had had an issue with.||58 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|Kate Bennett|Super thick|Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2018|Color: BlueVerified Purchase|This mat is very thick, well-made and provides a lot of cushioning for floor exercises (yoga, Pilates, etc).

It really is good for those with bad knees or joint replacements. HOWEVER, I've just discovered that the material is releasing fine dust of toxic materials and I've probably been breathing this in over the years. Horrifying.||I hadn't used the mat in a couple of weeks and thus decided to run a Swifter dust rag over it (lightly). Imagine my horror when I saw fine bits of dust captured on the rag as you can see from the photo. This isn't just paint, though that would be bad enough. It's actually tiny particles that are obviously part of the material. When I think of all the times I've rubbed against this mat doing exercises, or doing stretches in my pajamas and going straight to bed and transferring all that toxic dust from clothes and hair into my mattress, it literally makes me sick. Do not buy. Wait until hopefully another manufacturer makes a high quality product.||||8 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|manderkaym|Definitely like laying on a cloud.|Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2017|Color: PinkVerified Purchase|I LOVE THIS MAT!

I love the lines on the top, too, because I can easily position myself to align with the design for a more symmetrical yoga pose. I\\'m 5\\' 9\" tall and the mat is a great length for me. I thought it might be too narrow, but honestly even with my weight I think the size is perfect! And there\\'s no slipping, did I mention that yet?!

I set them up with our elf on the shelf one morning and they went nuts with delight, the chemical odor present once opened dissipates within minutes, no big deal and we didn't give it a second thought to hop right on after a quick wipe down and get to yoga-ing!

I got the pink color. I was always interested in starting but wasn\u2019t sure what yoga mat to go with or even if I would stick with yoga, so was cost conscious. My first impression was that I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and thickness of this mat. I am 5\u20196 and have no problem at all doing everything I need to on the mat with plenty of space. I don\u2019t slide on the mat, and it cleans so easily. It looks the same as the day I got it and I\u2019ve used the mat everyday. I have mine on carpet, so not sure how it would work on a different surface but can imagine carpet would be the hardest surface to work on. With the exception of combinations that require all body weight on one knee, the thickness of the mat is enough to cushion and support my body. Highly recommend for a first mat. It serves its purpose and a plus is its pretty! The last thing I\u2019ve really enjoyed is the strap it comes with. So easy to roll up and store as well as carry for class. Some other reviews have posted about a strange smell, mine did not smell. I have the pink and it hasn\u2019t worn down or left pink marks on the carpet or at the studio I take classes at.

I am new to yoga and don\u2019t want to spend a lot of money to do things that I\u2019m not sure of my exact preferences. But I have to tell you that this is the truth. I am a little heavy and have been borrowing money. I know I want something comfortable, but I don't want to be a princess and a pea. After several uses, I can confidently say that even if there is no slippage, it is very small. And the filling is excellent. It is soft and comfortable, but it is also hard enough when you are not in the right position or your weight is not properly distributed.

I have hyperhidrosis and sweat a lot. I tried very hard to buy a yoga mat that was appropriate for hot yoga (I figure you sweat in that type of class even more than I naturally sweat) and knew that anything rubber/plastic (i.e., a traditional mat) would not be any better than the cheap $10 one I currently have. I researched for hours upon hours spread out over the past few months and decided to get this mat. I thought from the description and reviews that it would be perfect. BUT...I also thought that the WHOLE TOP LAYER was made of jute. That is NOT the case!! The darker color is not a darker jute color, but is rubber, which makes the mat incredibly slippery. I could not even get through one yoga session. I gave it an extra star because it IS very comfortable, as other reviewers have said.

My wife loves hers and has been using the handy carrying strap to take carry it with her on business trips. I was using a cheaper foam mat that was soft but slid around a lot and seemed to compress too much. This mat stays exactly where I put it, doesn't scoot when I move around on it, and provides just the right amount of padding to keep me comfortable. I've had some wrist pain since I started doing Yoga, and I think it was partially related to the mat shifting and compressing. I've noticed an improvement since I changed to the Ajna mat. It rolls and unrolls easily, and stores well. It's a great product, and I like the fact that I've received follow up emails from the seller to make sure I was happy with the product. I'd definitely recommend the mat and Ajna Wellbeing to others.|37 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|Sarah Bailey|Luxurious comfort and natural look|Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2018|Color: Earth BrownVerified Purchase|This mat is fantastic! I received it last week and have used it every day for my yoga practice. I'm a huge fan. It comes beautifully packaged, which lends great to gift giving. I'm a huge fan of the mat being made out of jute and being natural, as I'm organically conscious. I honestly had never heard of jute before but was an instant fan. This mat is super padded without being thick which was a nice surprise. I usually use a thin, non slip, rubber mat when I practice but will probably be using this new Ajna mat as my go to mat now, as the padding is fantastic and feels much better on my knees and feet. Even though it's a thin mat, it offers a very luxurious padding to it. When rolled out, I can press my palm into it and feel some sinkage into the mat which offers fantastic support and comfort. The free mat carrier that comes with it is a great touch too. I love the look of the black and tan weave; very natural looking. It even is a little longer than my usual mat which is nice. I highly recommend this mat and company to anyone!!!!|31 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse\", 'table': 'Color Earth BrownBrand AjnaMaterial JuteProduct Care Instructions Hand Wash OnlyItem Dimensions LxWxH 3.94 x 3.94 x 0.79 inchesItem Weight 4.4 Pounds', 'text_other_colors': ['<span class=\"a-list-item\"><div class=\"tooltip\"><span class=\"a-declarative\" data-action=\"swatchthumb-action\" data-swatchthumb-action=\"{&quot;dimIndex&quot;:0,&quot;dimValueIndex&quot;:0}\"><span class=\"a-button a-button-thumbnail a-button-toggle\" id=\"a-autoid-11\"><span class=\"a-button-inner\"><button class=\"a-button-text\" type=\"button\" id=\"a-autoid-11-announce\" aria-label=\"\"><span class=\"xoverlay\"></span><div class=\"twisterSwatchWrapper_0 twisterSwatchWrapper twisterImages thinWidthOverride\" style=\"max-width: none;\"><div class=\" twisterImageDivWrapper\"><img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51VXTGBBA6L._SS36_.jpg\" alt=\"Aura\" style=\"height:36px;

The mat is creased pretty tightly and so far none of the creases has smoothed themselves out which is just a personal pet peeve. I pulled in out of the package and the mat look like it was just jammed into the carrying case just enough to make it fit which made it quite difficult to take the mat out of the bag without almost destroying the bag. I pulled the matt out and it looks like theres some type of hair all over the colored side maybe from the bag but it looks like cat hair but I'm not too sure considering I dont own a cat.

Yea,$5.It served me well while I was beginning my yoga journey.This mat,however is worth every penny.The lines really helped improve my posture and they are quite intuitive if you've been doing yoga for any length of time. The mat is a perfect thickness. I've had another mat with greater thickness but it was squishy and made me off balance. This mat was so easy on my joints and with the solid thickness and the awesome grip of the mat, my balance was better as well. Overall, this mat gave me a much better yoga workout and less risk for injury. Selected 5 stars for durability as instructions were sent via email to help increase the longevity of the mat .

But a friend used her foldable yoga mat in her room. I had no idea they even existed. So I HAD to get one!! Amazon offers so many different colors and the price of this one is great. But I love the colors & yoga markings on mine. I read in the reviews that it\u2019s hard to fold back into its handy zipper pouch. So I took pics of it as I unfolded it. But you can still see the fold lines too. It\u2019s seriously a breeze, just keep halfing it like you\u2019re folding a sheet! Put it on the bottom area of your bag so it\u2019s not too heavy when you stand your bag upright. There\u2019s just enough stick for hands & feet. It\u2019s honestly a game changer for any road and air warrior, or any overnight, yoga in the park, etc. The mat comes with a strap if you want to carry it.

I got the pink color. I was always interested in starting but wasn\u2019t sure what yoga mat to go with or even if I would stick with yoga, so was cost conscious. My first impression was that I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and thickness of this mat. I am 5\u20196 and have no problem at all doing everything I need to on the mat with plenty of space. I don\u2019t slide on the mat, and it cleans so easily. It looks the same as the day I got it and I\u2019ve used the mat everyday. I have mine on carpet, so not sure how it would work on a different surface but can imagine carpet would be the hardest surface to work on. With the exception of combinations that require all body weight on one knee, the thickness of the mat is enough to cushion and support my body. Highly recommend for a first mat. It serves its purpose and a plus is its pretty! The last thing I\u2019ve really enjoyed is the strap it comes with. So easy to roll up and store as well as carry for class. Some other reviews have posted about a strange smell, mine did not smell. I have the pink and it hasn\u2019t worn down or left pink marks on the carpet or at the studio I take classes at.

I used to go into the pilates studio but am now doing a Zoom class due to Covid. Pros: I love the fact that this mat is oversized and that I can hang it to get it out of the way. It does not slide on my floor. Cons: There was a slight odor initially but it disappeared within a week. While the mat is supposedly 10mm thick, it is fairly soft and therefore I wish it was a little thicker for cushioning.

I purchased a cheaper one for my daughter, for when she wants to be my shadow. The mat has a nice grip on my hard wood floors, which was initially a big concern. I do slip a bit here and there on the mat itself, so I probably wouldn't recommend it for hot yoga. I really liked that it came with a bag and a the strap to carry it. The bag is cheap and didn't last more than a week but the strap fits nice.|Another HUGE plus, for me at least, is that it had no smell. NONE.

After I wiped it down,the smell went away and the grip was MUCH better for my feet. The mat stays in place and does not slide on the floor and the thickness is perfect! My aging knees and elbows feel much better after a class than they used to. When I practice at home, I often refer to it for pose ideas and accuracy for form. I would recommend this mat for beginners or advanced yogis.|83 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|sonia|Within you home in your comfy clothes no need to pay for yoga|Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2019|Color: PurpleVerified Purchase|One of my best purchases ever ! My right hip and right shoulder pain gone and I think I lost 2-3 pounds and few inches and definitely more calm and feeling of \u201c toned \u201c ! First I bought for myself, then ordered 3 more for hubby, maid and office employee ! Sent the link to sis in laws and they ordered too. I mean you don\u2019t have to drive no where, no need to look all fancy and pay someone ! My kid does HW and I do little yoga in my comfy clothes ! I try positions that are easy to do for me and slowly slowly trying the tough ones now.

I love the thought process in the design, they were definitely thinking of me in that process. Add much as i love the design i still find room for improvement. It is rather slippery, but i find that with most mats. I would love it it had that cloth like finish I\\'ve seen on some mats. Love the size and weight, couldn\\'t give it 5 stars though because i find my bad knee still need a little extra cushioning. Even though i felt the price was fare, its still a little pricey.

It is thick and cushiony and very comfortable to lay or lean on to do exercises or just to have some extra cushion on the floor. Like the color its very pretty. It has a nice carrying bag but also comes with a strap to carry the mat itself which is nice. Seem to be very durable and should hold up well overtime. Overall I am very happy with this yoga mat and would definitely purchase again in the future if I need one.||12 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|Elise|Super plush and great grip|Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2021|Size: 72\"x24\"x1/3\"Color: Parfait Pink & GrayVerified Purchase|Longer than my last may but this one has so much grip and it\u2019s nice, thick padding. My toddler has taken to doing baby somersaults on it! Plenty of room for any position. Wipes down easily. The carrying case is kind of difficult to get the mat back into and after a few attempts I gave up and just used my other carrier to bring it to and from the studio. So far has exceeded my expectations and had no weird smells upon receiving.|7 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|MF|Very pleased with this mat|Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2021|Size: 72\"x24\"x1/3\"Color: Vibrant Green & BlackVerified Purchase|I bought two green mats for my husband and I. First, we admired the calming leaf green color. I started using it and found that it has a great amount of cushion and grip. At first, it wasn\u2019t as grippy as I thought, but I had just washed my hands and they were pretty dry. Once my body warmed up, it had really great grip. It feels very well made and sturdy. The length is great. It is a little narrower than my previous mat, but I don\u2019t find that to be a downside. The carrying case and strap are nice bonuses. Overall, this is a great deal for such a great mat.|Helpful|Report abuse|Chien Kai Wang|Love the color and its grip|Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2021|Size: 72\"x24\"x1/3\"Color: Vibrant Green & BlackVerified Purchase|The first thing that pops out when I opened the package is its color! I love the low profile green look it has, not too bright and not too dark that it looks dirty.||Grip was also something I care a lot about when purchasing a yoga mat, my previous one slips so much during work outs that I had to get rid of it and used it as a camping mat lol. Plus it protects my spine/knees well after every 1-hour work outs!||I would say this yoga mat serves just as good as all the pricy ones out there!|One person found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|R.

It cushiony and think and very comfortable. You will never regret buying it. The Colour is also very pretty and pleasant. It comes with a carry bag and a tie, making it very comfortable to fold and ties and put it back to the carrying bag. Its carrying bag is also very elegant and comfortable to carry. Moreover, it had no weird smell when I opened it. Even my toddler loves somersaulting and some kids toga on it. Its length is perfect for me.

Folds down well for travel.|Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2018|Color: Blue SundialVerified Purchase|I bought this mat esp. for travel. This travel mat is 2mm thick, while some \"travel\" mats are thicker (I\\'ve seen up to 4mm thick) I think that kinda defeats the purpose. Even it it folds down fairly small in length and width the thicker mats are still going to take a LOT of room in your suitcase. Yes of course the thicker cushion would be nice, but for me makes it too large. I\\'ll make due with using it over carpet, an area rug, or with a towel in order to conserve space, while still providing a nice clean exercise surface (yes the \"dirty\" side folds against its self). So ... just something to think about there.||When I first received this mat it was coated some kind of oily film that made it impossible to use for yoga. I contacted Gaiam and asked about using something like dawn dishwash soap to clean. Here is their reply:||\"thanks for reaching out! Yes, sometimes residues can be left behind from the manufacturing process. Dish detergent is ok, but easy to over-do. If you use too much the mat can become an unpleasant sticky. Please use a 50/50 solution of water and vinegar or water and witch-hazel. Both vinegar and witch-hazel are natural disinfectants so they\\'ll clean the mat and kill any bacteria on it :) \"||I\\'ve scrubbed it once with 50/50 white vinegar and water, and it\\'s now working OK. I think after it breaks in it will be fine, if not ... perhaps one more scrubbing.|Read more|118 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|AJ|Nice Thin, Grippy Mat but shows wear quickly|Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2019|Color: Be FreeVerified Purchase|Overall, this mat is exactly what I was looking for with a few exceptions.||PROS:|*It\\'s thin, making it perfect traveling. It\\'s also nice for balance poses and for use on carpet.|*It has some grip, but I still slip some. After I wiped it down, it had more grip. I think with use, it will continue to get better.|*You can fold it in such a way that the bottom and top never touch.||CONS:|*The reason I gave it 4 and not 5 stars is mainly because the paint is easily rubbing off. I\\'ve used it for my daily 20 min practice for about 2 weeks, and you can easily see the wear in the picture. When I gently wiped down the mat, this got worse. I considered sending it back (who wants paint on their feet?), but I like everything else about it. And when searching, I didn\\'t find many with all the qualities I wanted.|*I thought, based on the description and the reviews, it would have some sort of built in carry strap, but mind didn\\'t have anything. So I\\'ve been brainstorming what to put it in when I travel.|*This isn\\'t a mat for those sensitive to chemical smells. The smell gets better with time, but after several weeks, I can still smell it.|Read more||||||||||||55 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|Opeola|but is definitely a good grip. I\\'ve used it on hardwood floor|Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2018|Color: Blue SundialVerified Purchase|Get you one of these. I haven\\'t travelled a single time without this mat since I bought it. It is so convenient to be able to pull out my own mat to studios when I\\'m on the road, and to be able to practice in hotel rooms, or at friends\\' homes on overnight stays. The mat isn\\'t sticky to the level of some of the specialty mats you\\'ll see out there (like the GAIAM roll-up models), but is definitely a good grip. I\\'ve used it on hardwood floor, carpet, and on the deck of a ship - it\\'s great. The only trouble I\\'ve ever had is that the mat is quite light (one of the things that makes it GREAT for travel), so wind will lift it up pretty easily.||The Folds: The lines on which this folds are deeply imprinted. It\\'s not just a mat that\\'s easy to crease, the creases are pressed in, so it sits flat and can\\'t \"pop up\" out of its fold. Overall, amazing buy.

It should be great for traveling! Of course, thickness is sacrificed for compactness, which is to be expected. If you need padding, this is not the mat for you! It definitely reeks of chemicals, but that was true of another Gaiam mat I once bought and the smell eventually disappeared. Most troubling is the slick surface\u2014per the instructions, though, I washed it, and it does seem better. I didn\u2019t have the Gaiam mat cleaner they recommend so I just washed it in the bathtub with warm water and vinegar, like I do for all of my mats. It\u2019s defintely better than it was and not so smelly. I\u2019m going to keep it.|35 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|D.

Super slick: yeah I know this is a problem with cheaper mats but my god, five minutes in and this mat was as slick as a slip and slide from the slightest sweat! My hand when flying in downward dog and I nearly face planted!||2: sticky: the mat paradoxically also can be absurdly sticky, stepping my foot forward pulled the mat along with it, I think this is due more to its super thin nature than anything.||3. Retains its creases: yes its a foldable mat but good luck getting them even slightly straightened out.||Ultimately I opted to practice without a mat for the retreat.||Yes I know it\u2019s only $20 but if I knew I\u2019d have these issues I\u2019d just buy a foam mat and donate it after.

I was so excited to use it that I failed to read the instructions before use. I did not follow the directions and wipe it down before use, as instructed. So, it was a little slippery for my sweating feet (hot yoga) and had a smell. Had I followed the directions, it would not have been slippery nor smelly. After I wiped it down,the smell went away and the grip was MUCH better for my feet. The mat stays in place and does not slide on the floor and the thickness is perfect! My aging knees and elbows feel much better after a class than they used to. When I practice at home, I often refer to it for pose ideas and accuracy for form. I would recommend this mat for beginners or advanced yogis.|83 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|sonia|Within you home in your comfy clothes no need to pay for yoga|Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2019|Color: PurpleVerified Purchase|One of my best purchases ever !

I have always used a mat that was extra cushioning. I was worried that this was going to be too hard but I was pleasantly surprised to find it to be a good mix between cushioned and firmness. My old yoga mat used to stretch way too much when I was in downward-facing dog. This one does not stretch which is a very good thing. One of its best attributes is that it is really grippy both to the floor and to my feet and hands. I chose the gray and black one and it is quite handsome. It comes with a bag and a strap. The bag has mesh sides to help it dry and not create mildew. The mat\\'s material does have a slight odor when brand new but it\\'s not too much and I didn\\'t find it irritating. It subsides within a few days. It\\'s not a huge deal but if I had one a slight complaint is that the mat\\'s grippiness makes it hard to get the mat back into the bag due to the material they chose for the bag. I used it at home so I just leave rolled in a basket so it\\'s not an issue for me but if you want to take it out to yoga sessions and you try to get it back in the bag you will remember me. Luckily, they also provide an elastic strap which is plenty to carry it around and seems to be the preferred method of most yogi\\'s. ....or maybe your yoga session will provide you with enough patience to get it back in the bag without frustration. ;) This is definitely not a deal-breaker since the mat is such a good quality for the price and it\\'s grippiness is a great thing. If you are considering this one, buy it, you won\\'t regret it. If you are new to yoga I really recommend the \"Yoga With Adrienne\" channel on YouTube and start with a 30-day \"Home\" series. She is amazing. I never thought I would do yoga since I could barely tie my shoes without pain and she has helped me immensely.|Read more||154 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|kouboura|Amazing Mat but...|Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2020|Color: A-Matcha green + BlackSize: Thickness-6mm(1/4 inch)Verified Purchase|This is such a great exercise mat! Like amazing! It\\'s super durable (I even tried to rip it just to make sure it had the same durability as advertised, rest assured it does), and I am just so in love with the color (I got matcha).||The only thing is that because its amazingly grippy on both sides, make sure you wear grippy socks or your sneakers. Since I live an apartment, don\\'t wear shoes in any living space (because of how I was raised), and just can\\'t seem to find my grippy socks, I\\'ve experienced some sort of chafing on my toes with and without wearing socks. And it kind of burns once I\\'m done working out. Not sensational burning but the type of burning when you can feel it, but not to the point that it hurts (but this kind of depends on your pain tolerance, and mine is pretty high). But as long as you try to minimize the friction between the mat and your precious toes like I did, you should be fine, even if it does slightly affect the efficiency of your workout.||So all in all, amazing, amazing workout mat. Don\\'t hesitate at all just buy it! Even if there seem to be similar ones on amazon for a lower price (rip-offs in my opinion) just know that you\\'re paying for the quality and durability of the product.||And before I forget, when I put 5 stars it\\'s only for the mat itself. The carrying bag is just okay. And I understand this because the company probably spent tons of money on perfecting their mat and didn\\'t have much left to spend on manufacturing the carrying bags. Because of this my bag ripped along where the mesh like material and the bottom of the bag meet on my third day of using it, mind you they were three consecutive days. As long as you are extremely, EXTREMELY careful with putting the mat into the bag you should be fine.||Anyways, the bag doesn\\'t really matter right? It\\'s the mat you\\'re really buying so go ahead and get this one.||update: so it\u2019s been about a month and a half of me using this mat, and the top of the bag has completely frayed which has rendered the drawstring ability of the bag useless, and unusable for that matter. I\u2019ve attached a photo as well. Given all of this, you might want to get a better quality bag if you plan on transporting the mat often.|Read more||||||||||||80 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|KateBumbleBee|SO SO Happy!|Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2020|Color: Gold pink + GreySize: Thickness-6mm(1/4 inch)Verified Purchase|I\\'ve had this for 24hrs and it\\'s been one of my favorite purchases!

It was the perfect addition to my home gym and saves me precious floor space. I don't know what the other reviewer was talking about. This comes in four pieces. The two cross bars screw into the two support brackets. Then you use four screws to secure it to the wall. It comes with a leveler which was a really nice touch. I have loaded this thing up to the brim. I have my 4 ft foam roller, my TWO yoga mats, knee support mat, my stretching ropes and my resistance bands on this thing and it could probably handle more weight if I hadn't run out of room.

It holds yoga mats and massage rollers with ease, adds a few hooks to hang bands, and provides a decent aesthetic to my nascent garage workout gym.||It is just... very basic. Thin coated metal pieces joined together by a couple screws, then mounted to a wall. The cost of this must have been extremely minimal. I still bought it, but once I opened up the packaging and pulled out the pieces, I sorta questioned why I paid $24 for this thing, when honestly the fair value should probably be $12-15. No plan to return though.

It's a great little rack except I used the hardware that was included with it and that was a BIG mistake. The anchors blew a giant hole into the wall and just didn't grab onto the drywall well. I was worried it was going to pull out from the wall because it just wasn't secure. Rather than remove it, patch and repaint the holes made and then using decent anchors and screws, I bought some clips from the hardware store and added them so that if the screws gave, it wouldn't pull away from the wall. I was irritated but it was my own fault because I didn't like the looks of those anchors at all and used them anyway. DON'T DO IT. Get yourself some decent screws and this thing will be fine.|10 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|Chris|Compact and sturdy storage!|Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2020|Color: WhiteVerified Purchase|I was so bummed when it sold out awhile back, so I jumped on it when it became available again!

It came with very nice metal dry wall anchors but ironically cheap screws (the ones for assembly worked great, just the ones provided to anchor it to the wall were cheap). I'd recommend using a screw driver instead of a drill to screw it to the wall once you have the drywall anchors in place or you may need to replace the screws. They provide screws that are white topped to match the shelving which is a nice touch, as long as you don't strip them and have to replace them.|A note on assembly, I used a screw driver for the quick and easy assembly, but I recommend not tightening down the screws too much. The white paint chips off of the metal shelf wires when the screw is tightened down all the way. Not a big deal. You don't really see it and you could always use white paint/nail polish to touch it up.|I was worried about buying online and getting a shelf that was too small, but the sizing of this one is perfect. My two thickest i.e. largest yoga mats fit on it perfectly. They don't unroll. They are easy to retrieve. My foam roller also fits. As you can see from the pictures, the length of the prongs extending out are perfect, just long enough to hold your equipment without being too long, and long enough that everything rests fully on the prongs. I wish there was a little shelf for yoga blocks. I have yet to hang my straps on it.|Totally happy with it. You could even use extra wall paint to paint it the color of your walls for further blending. I would highly recommend this to get your equipment off the floor, out of your way, and in a clean, easily accessible spot.|Read more|||||Helpful|Report abuse|caslansis|Great space saver and organizer|Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2020|Color: WhiteVerified Purchase|I really like this product!

It is a neat way to organize home gym equipment and getting the stuff out of my closet will make me more likey to use it... I hope. My only complaint is that the white paint was kind of cheap. The very first screw I tightened to assemble the mount caused some of the paint to chip off around the screw. So go slow and don't tighten it too much.

It is so undependable I won't even attempt advanced poses on it for fear of serious injury. Can't return it because I bought it Sept 5th then had to have foot surgery so I am just now getting to use it and find out how awful it really is. I won't even give it to a fellow yogi because I would feel responsible if they got hurt!

If you don't have the patient to read the whoel article, please focus on the 3 downsides of this yoga mat I pointed out!!||I was looking for a bigger yoga mat. I did lots of researches, read customer. reviews on Amazon and also compared the prices, etc. At the end I decided to purchase this product because of the good reviews, nice color selections and the bigger size. I was thrilled to receive the product and started to practice my daily yoga right away. I felt pains on my both knees just after a few cat and cow poses because this mat is too thin. I regretted immediately but decided to give it another chance. I kept convincing myself that the purpose of getting this yoga mat is that it is bigger and my feet won't stick out of the mat so easily. However,,,,,,,,To cut a long story short, there are 3 major problem with this mat:||1. It is way too thin|2. It is very difficult to clean|3. It creates strong static electricity with wood floor|3 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|sjiamxx|Super worth it|Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2020|Color: Orange/GreyVerified Purchase|I have been looking for a yoga mat for a long time, and finally decided to get this one.

Flimsily material and case is useless.|Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2020|Color: Orange/GreyVerified Purchase|This is a good size, and great non slip material. But it\u2019s extremely thin and the material is almost brittle, like foam. My dog punctured it just trotting across it. Also stains quite easily if you use it outdoors, or out on your porch or deck, you\u2019ll have dirt and scuff marks, so get a dark color. Probably my biggest pet peeve with this mat is the case. It\u2019s so hard to roll it up as tight as it needs to be to easily slide back in, it starts unfolding, then the non slip material makes it almost impossible.

The last one I received from another seller was really cute but so thin I could only use it on plush carpeted areas. This mat however is the perfect thickness so I can use it on any surface tile or carpet. It was packaged very nicely and I adore that it already comes with a holder! I got the pink and grey one and I love the shade of pink I was afraid it wouldn\u2019t be like the picture or be too thin but it did not disappoint!|28 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|Sylvia Wu|recommended and comfortable yoga mat|Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2021|Size: 72\"x24\"Color: Parfait Pink & GrayVerified Purchase|This mat is so light and beautiful!

It has no electronics, buttons, or moving parts, so I\\'m not sure how much there is to review.||The mat is a good size for my wife and teenage daughter. It\\'s too small for me 6ft 2, but that\\'s not a problem because large men are not the typical market for these products.||The material of the mat is billed as more eco-friendly. It feels fine to the hand and is sufficiently grippy to the hand and foot. Ours hasn\\'t gotten enough sweat on it for me to judge how funky it will get over time, and we haven\\'t had it long enough to judge durability.||The carrying bag is of decent quality and should give enough ventilation. The bundled cord also works fine, if for some reason the bag is abit bulky for your needs.|24 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|Jobobamobob|Nice mat for the price, saves my knees!

I ordered this because I'm now practicing in a space with hardwood floors and *do* have some joint issues. Yes, it's very soft and cushy. However, I think this actually compromises you where pressure and gravity are actually beneficial in certain poses. For example- in child's pose when having a little pressure on your forehead actually relaxes you. You're not going to get that with this mat. You'll need a block or something. Neither will you be able to splay your limbs out evenly in shavasana. Just stuff to keep in mind because it's so thick. The plus side is if your knees are sensitive- this mat is a dream. It rolls up pretty big. You can't use the strap for anything other than keeping it rolled and neat. I've also noticed it's not as sticky and slides when I try to hop on it. If I were to make this mat better, I'd fix that, 'cause that could be dangerous. Give it some texture on the underside and make the strap less flimsy. *shrug* I'll update my review after I've used it for a few months.|126 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|Amelia|LOVE IT!!|Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2018|Color: PinkVerified Purchase|Let me just say, this thing is AMAZING!!

It really is good for those with bad knees or joint replacements. HOWEVER, I've just discovered that the material is releasing fine dust of toxic materials and I've probably been breathing this in over the years. Horrifying.||I hadn't used the mat in a couple of weeks and thus decided to run a Swifter dust rag over it (lightly). Imagine my horror when I saw fine bits of dust captured on the rag as you can see from the photo. This isn't just paint, though that would be bad enough. It's actually tiny particles that are obviously part of the material. When I think of all the times I've rubbed against this mat doing exercises, or doing stretches in my pajamas and going straight to bed and transferring all that toxic dust from clothes and hair into my mattress, it literally makes me sick. Do not buy.

I got the pink color. I was always interested in starting but wasn\u2019t sure what yoga mat to go with or even if I would stick with yoga, so was cost conscious. My first impression was that I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and thickness of this mat. I am 5\u20196 and have no problem at all doing everything I need to on the mat with plenty of space. I don\u2019t slide on the mat, and it cleans so easily. It looks the same as the day I got it and I\u2019ve used the mat everyday. I have mine on carpet, so not sure how it would work on a different surface but can imagine carpet would be the hardest surface to work on. With the exception of combinations that require all body weight on one knee, the thickness of the mat is enough to cushion and support my body. Highly recommend for a first mat. It serves its purpose and a plus is its pretty! The last thing I\u2019ve really enjoyed is the strap it comes with. So easy to roll up and store as well as carry for class. Some other reviews have posted about a strange smell, mine did not smell. I have the pink and it hasn\u2019t worn down or left pink marks on the carpet or at the studio I take classes at.

I am a little heavy and have been borrowing money. I know I want something comfortable, but I don't want to be a princess and a pea. After several uses, I can confidently say that even if there is no slippage, it is very small. And the filling is excellent.

It is available in various colors, lovely design, lightweight, average grip, isn\\'t sweat proof, signs of wear are inevitable and will appear quickly. Along with the mat you receive a bonus free yoga workout (that you need to download).||I\u2019ve been using this mat for several months before writing this review. I\u2019m practicing yoga 3-5 times a week (Vinyasa, Ashtanga, Power Yoga) and already tried several mats.||The pros:||Relatively affordable \u2013 This was the first yoga mat that I purchased for myself. When I began practicing yoga, I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be consistent. That\u2019s why I preferred to start with something simple and upgrade over time. And among the possible yoga mats that were available (on Amazon in my case), this model of GAIAM yoga mat was one of the least expensive.||Nice colors & prints \u2013 There are various combinations of vivid colors & paintings for this mat. I believe most of you will find at least one design that would earn your attention.||Non-toxic & 6P free - According to the Amazon product page, this latex-free mat is free of six of the most harmful phthalates (\"...PVC yoga mat is a healthier choice for you and the planet and free of DEHP, DBP, BBP, DINP, DIDP and DNOP\").||I\\'m not a certified authority to confirm those terms, thus I will have to trust the GAIAM\\'s promises that this is an environment-friendly mat.||Lightweight - The mat doesn\\'t weight much and is easy to carry, which makes it suitable for travel.||Doesn\\'t stink - So far, the mat didn\\'t catch any sweat odor, which is a good sign.||You get free yoga class \u2013 purchasing the GAIAM yoga mat grants you a free bonus downloadable yoga workout to help get you started.||The cons:||Basic mat \u2013 eventually, this is a basic yoga and exercise mat. You probably will be able to find similar mats in many stores (on-line & off-line).||In my opinion, what differentiates this mat from others, is the GAIAM brand that is considered a familiar brand, and the lovely designs.||Durability \u2013 Most yoga mats eventually show signs of wear and tear. This specific mat lasted quite well in the several months I\u2019ve been using it, but it showed signs of wear after several practices (scratches, the print goes off a slowly). I believe extensive use will cause the print to disappear fast.||Curves on the edges - Even after several months of use, the edges of the mat are still rounded because I roll the mat before/after the practice. Maybe there\\'s a solution to that, but I\\'m the kind of user that wants to open-practice-roll back till next practice kind of person. Thus, I prefer a mat with minimum maintenance requirements.||Overall, I think this is an OK mat for beginners. And yet, I believe there are better alternatives though, especially if you\u2019re into Yoga.||Please note I attached to this review photos of my GAIAM yoga mat.|Read more||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||100 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|dreamlandia|gaiam yoga mats are quality stuff|Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2017|Color: HamsaVerified Purchase|ugh.

Just because they\\'ve removed all these harsh materials from the products, does not mean it\\'s safe. They do not have to report what they use as fillers.

I can't seem to get it to lay perfectly flat at the edges. I still use it despite this flaw.|-----||Let me tell you all the reasons you will love this mat. Before I get started, I will tell you how I discovered this affordable yoga mat that has stayed with me for every hot, power, flow, restorative and vinyasa yoga class I have taken, ever since purchasing it. I, like many other beginning yogis, wanted to have the best yoga mat I could find. I looked online, I asked yoga teachers, I saw what yoga studios were using, and I watched a much of youtube videos narrowing it down to yoga mats like the Manduka Pro (which my boyfriend has) or the Jade Harmony Mat. For me, it was not going to be the Manduka (overpriced, and heavy/bulky) or the Jade Harmony (open-cell design which is gross because of all the sweat it absorbs). Instead, I took my brother's advice and searched high and low for something that would be: 1. affordable; 2. durable; 3. versatile for all the different classes and locations I practice yoga. This mat meets all those requirements and more and came to me via an online article, but that did not convey any sort of in-detail product review. It was a risk for me to buy it, but ultimately, I am satisfied and have kept the mat with me for the last few months and have tested it in a number of settings. Here is my pros and cons list:||Pros|Works everywhere - I have used it outdoors, in studios, and at home.||Has these two great center lines for building confidence and proper form. I love this feature. Its a great reminder to find proper form in every asana. I use it much more than I thought I would.||Sweat-resistant - I took this mat into several hot yoga classes without using a towel (which I recommend bringing along for any hot yoga class), it|held my planted feet really well. Surprising well. I believe it is able to do that because it has these small circle grippy dots all over it and that is just the right amount of friction to hold me up. I kid you not that I sweat so much in hot yoga (and power yogas) that I really believe that most normal mats would never be able to give me grip, but this one exceeded my expectations completely.||Color is exactly as advertised and I love it. It wakes me up.||I never noticed a smell. If there was one, it went away fast.||Easy and Fast Cleaning - the material really allows you to easy clean it which was one of my main concerns. I like the closed-cell format which does not hold onto any of my sweat.||Nice Thickness - I like the thickness. It is much more supportive and gentle on my body. Since using this mat, I never feel pain or the hardness of the ground in my knees anymore. This was a huge bonus for me.||Lightweight - I was pleasantly surprised at how light this yoga mat is. It is much lighter than my book bag and most things I carry. You will never feel the weight of this mat especially with the included strap, which I also love and use. However, if you are not very thin, you might have a hard time carrying it with the strap across your chest and back. But over the shoulder will certainly be fine. It is very adjustable so you will find what configuration works for you.||Cons|When you roll it out, you will notice that it does not always lay exactly flat. It holds some of its curve towards the edges. A really easy solution I use for this is I roll it up upside down which means whenever I open it, I flip it so the curved edges are slopping to the floor. Once I start hopping around on my mat and getting into warrior positions and downward dogs, the mat is laying perfectly flat and out of the way.||That is my most honest and unsolicited review. I'm a yogi and if you need a mat that is affordable, but worthy of an advanced yogi, I would look no further. This did it for me. After several weeks of using it, it is holding up really well, no signs of peeling, or flaking, like the yoga mats from Walmart do after the first use.|Read more|171 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|Sarah K|Seems to be an average yoga mat.|Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2018|Color: GREENVerified Purchase|I love the line down the middle for aligning myself but that seems to be the only thing that separates this yoga mat from the cheaper ones. I was using a free one for a while and decided to upgrade. After reading all the great reviews, maybe my expectations were too high? Its a nice mat, don't get me wrong, but it moves around on my carpet. I will have to stop and adjust my mat about 30 minutes into my practice. I'm sure it would work better on hard floors but on carpet, it moves around. I don't have any issues of my hands or feet slipping, so that's a plus. Also dirt and dog hair doesn't grip onto this mat like it did on my older one. My main issue is after I unroll it, it doesn't lay flat right away. I have to use shoes to weight down both ends because they are curled up too much. I'm going to try to alternate which direction I roll it up, hopefully that will fix the problem. All-in-all, it's a good mat and it keeps my feet from sliding around.|31 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|EmStep|Ive been looking for a quality mat that is easy to transport|Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2018|Color: GREENVerified Purchase|Ive been looking for a quality mat that is easy to transport, without breaking the bank.

After doing some research, I decided to purchase the Heath Yoga non slip mat. I purchased this mat for 3 reasons: 1) Price, 2) Cushioning and 3) Non-slip surface. The Heathyoga mat delivered on all three points, although the non-slip part seemed to be in jeopardy.||The customer-service rep responded to me quickly and was very helpful. They told that the new mats were coated with a resin that made their mats slippery with sweat. Their instructions were as follws:||* Wash your mat down with a soft brush and a non-oil based soap or heavily diluted vinegar (1:30) with warm water then rinse off. I usually do this in the shower if I can\\'t do it outside. Repeat if necessary.|* Hang dry outside in the sun if possible. DO NOT PUT IN WASHER or DRYER. The sun will help dry up the resins in your mat|* Hang dry over shower rod if you can\\'t dry outside. Make sure mat is completely dry before using.||After following their instructions, I decided to test my new mat in a yoga flow class. The yoga instructor suggested that students use a blanket for extra cushion for their knees, but the Heathyoga provided my with plenty of cushioning. Then came the moment of truth: would the Heathyoga mat live up to its claims of non-slippage?||Halfway through the class, sweat was pouring off of my body onto the mat where I placed my hands. I was afraid that I would end up skidding off of the mat and falling on my face, but true to their non-slip claim, I stuck to their mat like Spider-Man stick to walls!||I am very pleased with my Heatyoga Mat and would gladly recommend it to any practicing yogi|Read more|198 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|melly belly|Perfect!|Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2017|Verified Purchase|I love this mat so much. I\\'m in college and i needed one more unit so i took a beginner yoga class, i bought this mat after looking through probably 50 others, i don\\'t know why, I just felt like i needed the most perfect mat lol even though i haven\\'t had any experience with others.||One day in class, we needed to find a partner and there were moments when we needed to use each others mats. When i used hers, it felt super thin, like i could feel the floor underneath (maybe some people like that, i guess i don\\'t) and when we had to do Ardha Chandrasana, it was hurting my fingers, so i just was curious what brand she was using, i looked and it was one of the most expensive ones i remember seeing online!!! now maybe i was just doing the pose wrong haha but all i know is when i use my mat to do that pose, my fingers never hurt, so that moment was when i decided i needed to go online and leave a review... I love my mat! It\\'s seriously perfect and the blue is really a beautiful color!|*my only two cons:|-i wish they had some more designs to choose from|-one time in the class so far, i was super hot and it felt like my hands were slipping a little, but that only happened once. And i had looked at the other mats this brand is selling and i noticed they actually sell a no slip mat too, which if i get super into yoga, i will look into buying.||But for now, my mat fits my needs perfectly, and i love that it came with the little Velcro strap and the carrier, i\\'m pretty hesitant about buying any other mats at this point..

You can tell Heathyoga put a lot of energy and care into creating this product, and I liked the advisory email I received telling me all about how best to store and clean it. It\\'s thick enough to do prolonged yin practise poses with comfort and has excellent grip even in the hottest bikram class. Was also looking at much more expensive ($70+ ) yoga mats and so glad i went with this one . The alignment guide on the mat is really helpful to make sure you get the most out of your postures by correctly aligning yourself . The mat has a rubbery smell when first unpacked but the manufacturer included a little note to assure you that the smell is just a byproduct of the manufacturing process and that the smell will dissipate within a few days , and it did. The mat is a little wider then normal yoga mats (+ about 2\" either side ) which makes practice much more comfortable . It comes with a strap to keep the mat rolled and a clever piece of chord that you can loop around both ends for hands free carrying when running to your yoga class.|I recommend this to everyone, you will never want to go back to a regular yoga mat.|||99 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse', 'table': 'Color TurquoiseBrand HeathyogaMaterial Durable Eco-friendly TPEProduct Care Instructions Hand Wash OnlyItem Dimensions LxWxH 72 x 26 x 0.25 inchesItem Thickness 0.6 CentimetersItem Weight 2.2 Pounds', 'text_other_colors': ['<span class=\"a-list-item\"><div class=\"tooltip\"><span class=\"a-declarative\" data-action=\"swatchthumb-action\" data-swatchthumb-action=\"{&quot;dimIndex&quot;:0,&quot;dimValueIndex&quot;:0}\"><span class=\"a-button a-button-thumbnail a-button-toggle\" id=\"a-autoid-11\"><span class=\"a-button-inner\"><button class=\"a-button-text\" type=\"button\" id=\"a-autoid-11-announce\" aria-label=\"\"><span class=\"xoverlay\"></span><div class=\"twisterSwatchWrapper_0 twisterSwatchWrapper twisterImages thinWidthOverride\" style=\"max-width: none;\"><div class=\" twisterImageDivWrapper\"><img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51CF9WGp1RL._SS36_.jpg\" alt=\"Charcoal\" style=\"height:36px;

The 3-4mm thickness is perfect for balancing poses and offers enough padding to protect joints from the hard floor.|My feline companion and I examined the curling at the ends of the mat that we had read reveiws about. We decided it\\'s normal; especially when the mat is getting rolled up. We also noted that if we place our yoga block over the rolled edge until needed the mat gradually relaxes. TADA! No bigs.

The color is beautiful. However this product is not the yoga mat advertised. I happen to already have a Gaiam mat already but it\\'s black and I just wanted a pretty color. this is not a gaiam mat. my mat has the name on it. this one does not. the quality is different. also this matter is not two toned. the aqua color is beautiful but it is advertised as being two toned.

Cruz|Avoid, this is a very slippery mat|Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2016|Verified Purchase|I have owned and used this mat for the past three months. I am not a very sweaty person but this mat is so slippery that I could not hold downward dog for more than a second. I tried washing this mat with soap/water and water/vinegar but it did not make a difference. I am not sure if you can tell by the picture but the mat is made out of a slippery plastic material. Small amounts of moisture will make you slide.||I brought this mat for a really good price so I do not feel completely ripped off. If you are looking to buy your first yoga mat, I recommend buying any of the other cheaper ones on Amazon. I would not buy this item for full price and do not recommend this product for any physical activity.||||57 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|FL Guy|A very good mat, nice material, with just a couple very slight compromises|Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2020|Verified Purchase|I really like this mat - enough much that I bought a couple (for different locations).||Pros: very good materials, little or no initial smell, much better than \\'standard\\' sizes, and the price is reasonable imo.||Cons/Compromises for improved portability (and cost):|1) Comfortable for me, but not the absolute thickest. Of course, thicker would make it bulkier and heavier.|2) I love the extra length, could also be wider BUT that would add weight and bulk grip it less portable (as well as adding to the cost)|3) Good balance of grip without being overly sticky/noisy for me. Might not have enough for ultra sweaty hot yoga.||A very welcome upgrade from standard size and/or lower quality cheap mats imo. Recommended.|One person found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|Potassium|Good lasting value and quality for price, no problems with too much slip or too much stick.|Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2014|Verified Purchase|I ordered the Meadow design. A note to the perceptive: The image on Amazon implies that this item is bicolor on both sides. That is an editing mistake, as the original image does not show the entire item. It is one color on either side, as described.||I have owned one mat from Gaiam before this one, and it has been in irregular use for 2-3 years now by two different people. By irregular, I mean 2-3 times a week on average. The old mat has no signs of damage, does not slip on the ground, nor do my hands or feet slip when in a posture. The new mat is just as good, and I imagine it to hold out throughout the years just as well. A good lasting value for the cheap price. Of course, natural rubber mats would definitely be superior to this type. Unfortunately (as far as I know), Gaiam does not offer mats in any different lengths. I am 5\\'11 and would have liked a mat that could fit my entire body when laying down. But this design is very relaxing to me, and makes me pretty happy when I do yoga on it. Gaiam does offer a variety of thicknesses, but not for every design. A thicker mat may be appropriate for you if you are looking for more support and comfort, and may also help in reducing any slip...which I will move on to.||I see lots of comments here about people slipping. Different mats will have qualities and one must adapt. If you are slipping, you are likely sweating (even the tiniest bit of sweat on your hands can have an effect) or are not distributing your body weight appropriately in certain postures. For the former, you can use different products for that (gripping gloves, chalk, different kinds of mats, or a yoga towel, even). For the latter, like mentioned before, you must adapt. I have experienced a very negligible slide under my hands when in downward dog in the past, but I have comfortably adjusted that posture to maintain steady on the mat. I have not noticed any moments where I felt that this mat was unsafe or unfit for a particular posture. I also had no problems with the mat being too sticky and becoming damaged from that.||Overall, I recommend this product to anyone looking for a standard yoga mat.|Read more|17 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse', 'table': 'Color Granite StormBrand GaiamProduct Care InstructionsYoga mats release a very strong but harmless odor when first unwrapped.\u2026 See moreItem Dimensions LxWxH 68 x 24 x 0.16 inchesItem Weight 0.9 Kilograms', 'text_other_colors': ['<span class=\"a-list-item\"><div class=\"tooltip\"><span class=\"a-declarative\" data-action=\"swatchthumb-action\" data-swatchthumb-action=\"{&quot;dimIndex&quot;:0,&quot;dimValueIndex&quot;:0}\"><span class=\"a-button a-button-thumbnail a-button-toggle\" id=\"a-autoid-10\"><span class=\"a-button-inner\"><button class=\"a-button-text\" type=\"button\" aria-label=\"\" id=\"a-autoid-10-announce\"><span class=\"xoverlay\"></span><div class=\"\"><div class=\"\"><img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51l+VLD0b-L._SS36_.jpg\" alt=\"Granite Storm\" style=\"height:36px;

I took a spray bottle to yoga with me just in case but found I didn\u2019t need it, in the brief warmup before my first down dog I had already developed enough perspiration to become tacky. This mat outperforms my Manduka Pro in every way. It feels great, smells great, looks great and best of all I\u2019m not having to wipe my mat off before wheel anymore. Every droplet that falls on this mat just makes it better so I can focus on working harder rather than the puddle of slippery death that would be forming.||Reviews seem to be split on longevity and buildup of oils reducing the performance of cork but my initial impressions are positive, time will tell. I have to believe proper care and maintenance will give this mat a long life.||In closing, if you\u2019re struggling with grip in sweaty sessions like I was don\u2019t hesitate to give this mat a try.

As a yoga teacher, I rarely am actually on my mat, but have found that the cork actually peels off in little tiny pieces. It\\'s only a very thin layer of cork over the foam and though I thought I would love the thicker mat, it is heavy and akward to use and carry.

I do Beachbody workouts and use this mat every single day. It has been a real joint saver for me. No pressure on my knees whatsoever!!! Also my wrist doesn\\'t hurt that much when planking. Forgot to mention the calm blue/ grey color. The mat smells a little bit like rubber but I like it, it is not that toxic smell that comes from cheap mats for $12. And the Rubber is natural. It is also on a heavier side, so if you decide to walk with the mat every day to your yoga practice you will feel it, but it comes with straps, so you can carry it on your shoulder. Since it is heavy it doesn\\'t move while working out - this is perfect! I love it and recommend it and for the beginners and for experienced yogas!

Doesn't adhere well to floor, either, in part because of the warped edges. UPDATE 5/26/21: Customer service at Devonlosky emailed me to send me a no-cost replacement. It is laying much flatter, especially when I roll it up with the gray working surface to the outside. It is a decent mat for the price, so I'm upgrading my review to 4 stars. I would give it 5 stars if it adhered to the floor a bit better. That said, it is lightweight for carrying and has plenty of cushion for my bony knees. The company appears very responsive and is eager to please customers, which I appreciated.||4 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|Kindle Customer|High quality Yoga mat|Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2021|Color: Dark Green/ Light GreenVerified Purchase|I was looking for a high quality Yoga mat and this fit everything I was searching for.

It's not too thick or too thin. It provides enough cushion to protect my knees from injury. The quality of this mat is very good!

The Dralegend Yoga Mat popped up on my feed. I am not a Yoga person so I did a lot of research. I needed a low impact exercise routine after have a complete knee replacement, I was in the military and a runner so this is new to me. I am please with my purchase, the mat is durable, doesn\\'t move when I work out, hard wood floors, and is easy to clean after a work out. My issue is I am bony, so my big issue is my tailbone/spine and I have little balance right now. This offers good support, I still use a towel under my tailbone, but as I struggle for balance and standing up it offers great grip on my floors. I really am impressed with the length as well, I am 5\\'7 and this mat offers a lot of length and width to move on. Overall it is a very well made mat, no funky smell after opening and laid flat after a few minutes. If you new to this or need extra mats the price and quality are outstanding. The mat arrived in a amazon box and was well secured and arrived in a timely manner. Do yourself a solid and get this mat.||94 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|eduardo gloriana|Bang for your buck|Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2020|Verified Purchase|I purchased this mat not so much for yoga but for at home workouts and it\u2019s held up pretty well so far.

But if I don\\'t get a satisfactory answer I\\'ll be reporting this product to Amazon as unsafe, and suggest others do the same.|16 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|Old Dog|Good buy|Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2020|Color: Red+BlackVerified Purchase|I bought this as an exercise mat, not for yoga; I\\'ve been using it on a tile surface during on-line workouts with a trainer, and so far, so good. Just about the perfect thickness, length, and width for me, at six feet and 200+ pounds. No signs of premature wear yet. And it isn\\'t too soft - just about right. It is a little bit \"grabby\" when I wear a cotton t-shirt. No issue with nylon or other fabrics, and it\\'s a minor annoyance, at worst. One big plus - it didn\\'t have the usual, awful smell some mats have out of the box. If it holds up reasonably well, I will buy it again.|10 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse|Cindy|Pretty good mat just not sweat resistant|Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2020|Color: Purple+PinkVerified Purchase|The mat does not slip on hardwoods. It is very comfortable and it feels like it is going to last for a while. The only negative that I have experienced so far is that when I was doing a high intensity workout, I was sweating and the mat did absorb it, but it left an immense sweat stain. It was slippery, but I just avoided it the rest of the workout. I am sure it is going to come out in the wash, but I was a bit surprised. But overall, I like the mat for its price.|10 people found this helpful|Helpful|Report abuse', 'table': 'Color Purple+PinkBrand DralegendMaterial TpeProduct Care Instructions Hand Wash OnlyItem Dimensions LxWxH 72 x 26 x 0.24 inchesItem Thickness 6 MillimetersItem Weight 907 Grams', 'text_other_colors': ['<span class=\"a-list-item\"><div class=\"tooltip\"><span class=\"a-declarative\" data-action=\"swatchthumb-action\" data-swatchthumb-action=\"{&quot;dimIndex&quot;:0,&quot;dimValueIndex&quot;:0}\"><span class=\"a-button a-button-thumbnail a-button-toggle\" id=\"a-autoid-11\"><span class=\"a-button-inner\"><button class=\"a-button-text\" type=\"button\" aria-label=\"\" id=\"a-autoid-11-announce\"><span class=\"xoverlay\"></span><div class=\"twisterSwatchWrapper_0 twisterSwatchWrapper twisterImages thinWidthOverride\" style=\"max-width: none;\"><div class=\" twisterImageDivWrapper\"><img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41sQLOZ332L._SS36_.jpg\" alt=\"Black+Gray\" style=\"height:36px;

It\\'s too small for me 6ft 2, but that\\'s not a problem because large men are not the typical market for these products.||The material of the mat is billed as more eco-friendly. It feels fine to the hand and is sufficiently grippy to the hand and foot. Ours hasn\\'t gotten enough sweat on it for me to judge how funky it will get over time, and we haven\\'t had it long enough to judge durability.||The carrying bag is of decent quality and should give enough ventilation.
